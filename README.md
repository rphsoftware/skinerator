# the skinerator

steals minecraft skins from servers

use cases:
- server has custom player heads
- server uses player models for NPCs (hypixel, wynncraft)

this mod collects all unique loaded skins in your game session and offers an in-game UI allowing you to browse them

by default it's bound to F13 so you should rebind it to something accessible.

you have the option to copy skin descriptor json to clipboard, open the skin in your web browser, ignore it with x or copy sNBT for usage in plugins command blocks and other stuff like that.

# note: the only supported version is 1.19. Building for older (1.18.2 etc) or newer (1.19.1+) versions is not supported and your issues will be closed unless you sponsor me for at least $10 a month.
